Faronix is a shell-native, declarative developer kernel that turns .manifestrc into fully functioning Django+HTMX dashboards, real-time infrastructure, and runtime intelligence.

Project Summary

Faronix is a shell-native, manifest-driven developer kernel that declaratively scaffolds real-time infrastructure, views, and dashboards via .manifestrc profiles. It unifies HTMX, Django, Zsh, Conda, and inotify-based runtime behavior into a single system that thinks like you do.

âœ… Real-time manifest rendering (no server restarts

âœ… HTMX + Django + JSON + shell working together

âœ… Declarative .manifestrc scaffolding engine

âœ… Inotify-ready for live dev mesh environments

âœ… Fully portable across physical, remote, and container servers

âœ… Built-in sidebar fragments, TabNav, and modular dashboards

- `.manifestrc` runtime scaffolding profile
  
- `faronix_generate.py` â€” manifest compiler
  
- Sidebar tab engine with rank-based RBAC
  
- HTMX-native table + modal rendering
  
- Inotify support for auto-runtime updates
  
- Bootstrap-ready for `.venv`, `.conda`, `.zshrc`, and `playbook boot`

- Fully modular â€” supports multi-view, multi-app builds
  
- MIT licensed, portable, and CI-ready

### ðŸ§ª For Developers

- Add new views by writing a JSON spec
  
- Regenerate views with no downtime
  
- Fully declarative: no boilerplate needed
